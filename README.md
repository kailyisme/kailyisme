### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
# kaily(she/her) is me ðŸ¥°

I am currently at Infinity Works (part of Accenture) as a Senior Associate Consultant

I have gone through the Infinity Works [Academy](https://www.infinityworks.com/academy/)
I also did the [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/our-courses/coding-bootcamp) bootcamp, learning JS and all its frameworks. 
Previously i learned [Data Engineering at Generation](https://uk.generation.org/manchester/data-engineering/) learning Python, SQL and AWS and how to build data pipelines locally and on the cloud.

I love retrogaming and simple looking games with a puzzle twist.
