### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
# Kaily(she/her) is me ðŸ¥°

I am currently at [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/our-courses/coding-bootcamp) learning JS and it's frameworks. 
I have just been learning [Data Engineering at Generation](https://uk.generation.org/manchester/data-engineering/) learning Python, SQL and AWS and how to build data pipelines locally and on the cloud.

I love retrogaming and simple looking games with a puzzle twist. Do you think we can collab on a project? [Let me know!](mailto:github@kailyis.me)
